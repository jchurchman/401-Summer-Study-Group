# Networking Strategies || How to break the ice

### Super low level ideas in this talk

- Recognize that everyone at a networking event is there for the same reason: to meet people!
- Pretty much everyone you'll meet at one of these events has felt socially awkward
- Candid is key
  - Along with attending to meet people, you're attending to learn. Don't act the expert when you're not -- though you're allowed to have opinions on the subject.
  - Admitting ignorance or false assumptions is a great way to establish common ground with other attendees.
  - It's ok if you forget someone's name. No one is really "great with names", just apologize for forgetting and ask their name again.
- Strategies:
  - The Barnacle
    - Hang on to someone who's been before, let them introduce you
    - If you're the experienced attendee, help your barnacle out
  - The Orbiter
    - If you want to talk with someone who's engaged in a convo, float near that convo and make eye contact with the person you want to speak with. They'll get the hint and ask what's up when it's appropriate.
    - Conversely, if you're engaged in a convo and you notice an orbiter: invite their participation at a natural pause in the convo.
  - The Questioner
    - Before the group breaks, there is usually a call for questions, ask a general question then. Follow up after the group breaks, either with the speaker or other attendees.
  - The Ass (Advanced Technique!)
    - Embarrass yourself in an overt way. Own it gracefully.
