## Job Search Stuff -

* Portfolio site - Everyone seems to suggest building one. As entry level devs, we need to sell ourselves.
* Practice!!!!
    * Foundational Skills --- LOTS of vanilla stuff
    * In demand frameworks/approaches -- React is hot, Redux is implied. Practice vanilla React.
    * New Frameworks. New languages? TypeScript!
    * __Read someone else's code. Contribute to other projects.__ Open Source Projects FTW!
